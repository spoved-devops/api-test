### API Interaction Demo

#### The challenge:
>*Instructions*
>We would like you to demonstrate your understanding of writing code to interact with APIâ€™s. To demonstrate this, your goal is to write a program which will pull contents from an API endpoint and write it to a database.
>
>Get the data from the following API endpoint. Its open, no authentication needed. https://api.nanoporetech.com/oracle/v1/requisitions
>Parse the output and insert it into a database of your choice. 
>
>*Solution notes*
>* In the solution please provide clear instructions that will allow us to replicate the solution. 
>* Use a docker container for the DB instance. Just off the shelf image is fine. (MySQL, Postgres)
>* You can use Python to write the code or any language of your choice. You can also use an ORM to interact with the database. (https://orator-orm.com/)
>* Commit often to show work in progress rather than one big push. 
>* The data installed does not have to delivery any particular functionality. 
>
>*Submitting*
>* Put your solution in a public Github or Gitlab repo and send a link. Include a clear README with installation instructions.

#### Outline Plan
* Determine data format
  * Curl to the URL
  * Determine fields/type etc.
* Identify target DB type/Docker image
  * Majority common fields -> SQL
  * Varying fields -> NoSQL/DocumentDB
* Script:
  * Extract into data structure
  * Create DB and schema
  * Transform as needed
  * Load into DB
* Look into using an ORM

#### Assumptions:
* Python3
* No custom image
* User/pass for DB specified on docker command line is fine
* No need to go as far as Docker Compose to bring up service etc.
* Overriding RUN/ENTRYPOINT from standard image is OK
  * e.g. Bind mount containing script to start DB, extract, transform, load
* No need to determine field names/types dynamically at run time
* System on which the solution will be replicated has Docker available

#### Instructions
Install PIP, setuptools, Orator and a MySQL client for Python3:
~~~
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3-setuptools
sudo pip3 install orator
sudo pip3 install PyMySQL
~~~

Fire up a Docker container running MySQL, creating a DB and setting credentials:
~~~
sudo docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=apitest -e MYSQL_USER=test-user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=test-pass mysql/mysql-server --default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password
~~~
